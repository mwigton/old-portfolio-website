            Target:&nbsp;&nbsp; IBM XT PC DOS<br />

            I volunteer at the Cold War Museum in my spare time and found a IBM PC XT in storage. I thought it would be a fun project so I took it home to figure out
            a cool project to do with it. First I had to get it running correctly, all of the hardware was in good shape but the hard drive was empty. I found a copy of DOS 2.0
            on 5 1/4 floppy on ebay with manuals. I ordered and installed them into the IBM. Once it was set up I figured out what I wanted to do, an emulation of the screens from
            the movie "War Games".
            
            <p>
            It was a simple enough project and a good introduction to coding in C. The next problem was writing software for it, there was no compiler included with DOS.
            I choose the OpenWatcom compiler and vim for editing. When I had it all set up, I was able to write code on my main machine, then deploy to the IBM.
            <p>I was able to do this by finding a computer which had usb ports and a floppy header. I used a universal floppy cable to hook up the 5 1/4 drive in the IBM to the computer, and after lots of trial and error,
            was able to write to a disk by using DOS 3. With that setup, I was able to put the exe produced from OpenWatcom in 16 bit mode on the flash drive and write it to the floppy. Then it was just a matter of copying the file
            to the hard disk of the IBM.
            </p>

            The computer is on display on the second floor of the museum.
